ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes have distinct formats: ICD-9 codes are 5 character long strings which are entirely numeric (with the exception of codes prefixed with \u201cE\u201d or \u201cV\u201d which are used for external causes of injury or supplemental classification). Importantly, ICD-9 codes are retained as strings in the database as the leading 0s in codes are meaningful. ICD-10 codes are 3-7 characters long and always prefixed by a letter followed by a set of numeric values."
